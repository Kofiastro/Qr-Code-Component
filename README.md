## My process

### Built with

- TailwindCss 


### What I learned

This is the beginning of using tailwindcss to build responsive pages using flexbox and media queries.The flexbox aprroach of doing things is a little bit different from grids but i want to use flexbox inorder to create vibrant and efficient responsive websites.I was able to identify how flex  , max-width and justify-content go hand in hand when it comes to alignment.Code Snippet that was helpful:

```html 
 <div class="flex flex-col bg-LightGray justify-center h-screen md:flex-row md:p-20 ">
    <!--Card-->
    <div class="mx-10 bg-white rounded-2xl md:m-8">
      <!--Flex Container-->
      <div class="flex flex-col p-6 items-center md:max-w-md ">
```
