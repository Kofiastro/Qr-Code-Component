## My process

### Built with

- TailwindCss 


### What I learned

This is the beginning of using tailwindcss to build responsive pages using flexbox and media queries.The flexbox aprroach of doing things is a little bit different from grids but i want to use flexbox inorder to create vibrant and efficient responsive websites.I was able to identify how flex  , max-width and justify-content go hand in hand when it comes to alignment.Code Snippet that was helpful:

```html 
<div class="flex flex-none flex-col bg-LightGray justify-center h-screen md:justify-center md:items-center">
      <!--Card-->
      <div class="mx-5 bg-white rounded-2xl md:pt-5 ">
        <!--Flex Container-->
        <div class="flex flex-none flex-col p-5 justify-center items-center md:justify-center md:items-center   ">
```
